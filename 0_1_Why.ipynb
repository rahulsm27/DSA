No other value Theta, Ms. Exact orderof growth, right? So we can't have anything else.Like we had in Big Oand Omega notation. We had some timeunions of certain things but we haveexact sets here. So if you see thisset this, as the leading termis linear, right? This is linear. This islinear. Login is slower growing. There is alsolinear so we can say it's Theta nhere.
