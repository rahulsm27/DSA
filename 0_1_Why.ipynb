      "Hi. In this video, we are going tointroduce a new topic hashing.Hashing is mainly used toimplement dictionaries, where youhave key value pairs. Itis also used to implementsets, where you have onlykey set of keys.The great thing about hashing isit provides search, insert,delete all three operations inBig O of one time onaverage. So let's understand what do Imean by search, insertdelete? So you have aset of keys for example,phone numbers of the people.You want toQuickly find details of aperson with given phonenumbers. So this is your searchoperation. You want to insert anew phone number as akey and value as the days ofthat person, this isinsertion operation. Ifthat phone number alreadyexists, then this insertionwill override the previousvalue. Please rememberin hash tables, or hashing. Wealways have unique values.All the values areUnique no duplicates allowed.So, if a phone number already exists, if a key alreadyexists. And if you try to insert againit will override the previous key.Delete operation, deleteis simply deleting the key and it'scorresponding value from the hashtable. Let us analyzeother data structures. How muchtime they take forthese insert, search and deleteoperations. All theother known data structuresare beaten by hashinghashing works best when youhave these three operations or asubset of these three operations. Forexample, if you want to do only search on aset of dataNo other data structure will give you big O ofone time for searching. Let'sanalyze other data structure one by one,suppose you insert all the keys inan array.If you store the keys inunordered fashion, then your search is going tobe linear time. Big O ofn. If you store thekeys in sorted form,then your search is going to be big O of log n.But then your insert will becomelinear. Because if you are using an array,then you will have to move all the items. When youare inserting in the middle, yourdelete will also become Big O ofn. So with arrays,you have Big O of log.In time for search Big Oof n time for insertand Big O of n time for delete, if yourdata is stored in a sortedway, if you store thedata in an unsorted way,then your insertand delete becomeBig O of one onaverage and search becomes BigO of n. So witharrays, you always have oneoperation which is Big O of n, you know, atleast one operation, if you are maintaining insorted form.Then insert and delete both are Big Oof nLet's talk about other data structures although wehave a binarysearch tree in the upcoming tracks,but let me give you some information about binary search treealso binary searchtrees, especiallyversions of the binary search tree likeAVL tree and red-black tree.They take big O of log ntime for searchinsert and deletebecause log n is still higher thanBig O of 1.Especially when you have large largedata, this big O of one is, you know,going to take much less time comparedto log n when n is really high,so hashing beatsarrays it beatsAVL tree and red-black trees because they are big O oflog n and it providesall these 3 operations in Big O ofone time. However, itdoes not provide certain operationswhich are provided byself-balancing binary, search trees like red black trees or aAVL TreeFor example, you can finda key which is just a smaller than thegiven key. If the given key is notpresent, you can find a keywhich is just above. than thegiven key in log n time ifyou're using AVL tree or red-blacktree but with hashingit is strict search.Whether the key is present or notpresent. Only that operation is Big O of 1.If you have to find theclosest Value, that will take Big Oof n time with hashing. If youhave to find all the values in ain given range that will also be acostly operation.You cannot get all the data issorted order. If you want to print all thekeys in sorted order, it's not aneasy operation will hashing. Sohashing you can consideras an expert data structure when youhave search insert and delete, onlywhen you are not interested in closest values and you arenot interested in sorted order.Here are three main areaswhere hashing isnot used to store a collectionof keys or key value. Pairsone is finding closest valueyou know ifsome key is not present, find the valuewhich is just small or just greater than this.Keeping the data in sorted order,right? So if you want to keep the data in sortedorder, if you want started,traversal hash is not recommendedway because the orderis not sorted according to thekeys. So these two places,we generally use AVLtree or red black tree,one of these self-balancingbinary search trees or maybe other versionsof these self-balancing binary search trees.We will talk about these in theupcoming.Tracks. The third area isprefix searching. Soif you want to find outall the keys that match with aparticular prefix inthat case also hashingis not useful because hashingdoes exact key search. Itdoes not do lowersmaller or prefix search forprefix searching, there is agood competitor of hashing which is Triedata structure,right? For a strings.Trie data structure is an alternate dictionaryimplementation that alsoprovides.Quick prefix search which is not therewith hashing. In thisvideo we introduce hashing.We talked about main threeoperationsWe talked about the places where it should notbe used in the nextvideo, we'll talk aboutapplications of hashing.always have unique values.PauseMuteRemaining Time -5:401.25xPlayback RateCaptionsautoFullscreenYou must watch the entire video without moving or skipping it for it to count towards your course progress.Introduction to Hashing785ReportIn this video, we delve into the world of Hashing.We discover the unparalleled effectiveness of hashing as the optimal method for data storage in the majority of scenarios, boasting an impressive O(1) complexity for operations such as Search, Insert, and Delete.If you are facing any issue on this page.

When youare inserting in the middle, yourdelete will also become Big O ofn. So with arrays,you have Big O of log.In time for search Big Oof n time for insertand Big O of n time for delete, if yourdata is stored in a sortedway, if you store thedata in an unsorted way,then your insertand delete becomeBig O of one onaverage and search becomes BigO of n. So witharrays, you always have oneoperation which is Big O of n, you know, atleast one operation, if you are maintaining insorted form.Then insert and delete both are Big Oof nLet's talk about other data structures although wehave a binarysearch tree in the upcoming tracks,but let me give you some information about binary search treealso binary searchtrees, especiallyversions of the binary search tree likeAVL tree and red-black tree.They take big O of log ntime for searchinsert and deletebecause log n is still higher thanBig O of 1.Especially when you have large largedata, this big O of one is, you know,going to take much less time comparedto log n when n is really high,so hashing beatsarrays it beatsAVL tree and red-black trees because they are big O oflog n and it providesall these 3 operations in Big O ofone time. However, itdoes not provide certain operationswhich are provided byself-balancing binary, search trees like red black trees or aAVL TreeFor example, you can finda key which is just a smaller than thegiven key. If the given key is notpresent, you can find a keywhich is just above. than thegiven key in log n time ifyou're using AVL tree or red-blacktree but with hashingit is strict search.Whether the key is present or notpresent. Only that operation is Big O of 1.If you have to find theclosest Value, that will take Big Oof n time with hashing. If youhave to find all the values in ain given range that will also be acostly operation.You cannot get all the data issorted order. If you want to print all thekeys in sorted order, it's not aneasy operation will hashing. Sohashing you can consideras an expert data structure when youhave search insert and delete, onlywhen you are not interested in closest values and you arenot interested in sorted order.Here are three main areaswhere hashing isnot used to store a collectionof keys or key value. Pairsone is finding closest valueyou know ifsome key is not present, find the valuewhich is just small or just greater than this.Keeping the data in sorted order,right? So if you want to keep the data in sortedorder, if you want started,traversal hash is not recommendedway because the orderis not sorted according to thekeys. So these two places,we generally use AVLtree or red black tree,one of these self-balancingbinary search trees or maybe other versionsof these self-balancing binary search trees.We will talk about these in theupcoming.Tracks. The third area isprefix searching. Soif you want to find outall the keys that match with aparticular prefix inthat case also hashingis not useful because hashingdoes exact key search. Itdoes not do lowersmaller or prefix search forprefix searching, there is agood competitor of hashing which is Triedata structure,right? For a strings.Trie data structure is an alternate dictionaryimplementation that alsoprovides.Quick prefix search which is not therewith hashing. In thisvideo we introduce hashing.We talked about main threeoperationsWe talked about the places where it should notbe used in the nextvideo, we'll talk aboutapplications of hashing.always have unique values.PauseMuteRemaining Time -5:401.25xPlayback RateCaptionsautoFullscreenYou must watch the entire video without moving or skipping it for it to count towards your course progress.Introduction to Hashing785ReportIn this video, we delve into the world of Hashing.We discover the unparalleled effectiveness of hashing as the optimal method for data storage in the majority of scenarios, boasting an impressive O(1) complexity for operations such as Search, Insert, and Delete.If you are facing any issue on this page.
